      <h3>Missions</h3>
      Some of the bosses around the town are looking for help from some groups. Talk to your area's boss with a group to help out on some larger missions. Max group sizes are 4 and difficulty of the tasks will depend on your group size. Join your group leader by entering your party code assigned.

      Some additional notes: There will be limited missions right now while we wrap up testing but we have built a framework for adding new tasks and making complex missions fast and easy so stay tuned for any larger mission releases. Please let us know if you encounter any issues so we can address them

      <h3>Limited Stock Cars</h3>
            Due to high volume of car trade many cars may be placed on backorder or certain models may have limited production. 
            Attempting to purchase a car that is out of stock will result in a message letting you know. 
            You can view how many are currently in circulation by viewing the Car Statistics tab at your local dealer.
            Please note this number is not how many are available at the time just how many are allowed in the city. 
            If you want to know how many may be left or who may be the owners of the limited stock please contact your local car salesman.
